It involved
Creating a new list called uniqueList.
Iterated through the original list.
Before adding each item to uniqueList, checked if it was already present.

Then we Used a Stack and pushed each element from uniqueList onto the stack.
Since stacks follow a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order, popping elements from the stack retrieves them in reverse order. 
Use a stack to reverse the list: 

Display the final reverse list
We the original list, the list after removing duplicates, and the final reversed list to clearly show the transformations.
